## Learning Objectives

* 


## Outline / Notes

* This lab should have them create multiple classes.
* I've set this lab up similar to the one prior which includes some tests to get you started.
* I like the idea of having them create many classes, each one with certain functionality so that way they get used to doing it.
* Feel free to not involve any UI unless you have a fun idea that would work here.
